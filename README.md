Approach
Divided the page into components: Header, Hero, Cards, Footer

Used CSS Grid for all layouts

Maintained all styles in a single App.css

Added hover states for buttons/cards

Ensured “The Digital Renaissance” breaks into two lines with CSS

Challenges
Adjusting spacing (padding/margin) across screen sizes

Positioning overlapping images (stone/hand)

Balancing typography size for readability

Known Issues
Mobile navigation is simplified (no hamburger menu yet)

Images may need optimization

Gradient/text styling could be refined further
